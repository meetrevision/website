### Internet/Sound/Bluetooth/other hardware... not working 

Install the driver. Help: [How to install drivers page](/faq/drivers)

#### I do not have internet after installing ReviOS 

You probably did not follow the ReviOS installation guide, where we recommend to download your driver before installation, exactly because of this situation. 

Use an other computer, or if your phone has mobile internet, use USB tethering, to download the network driver. More help finding the drivers on the [How to install drivers page](/faq/drivers).

<!-- ## If you do not have internet...

... is probably because you are missing the network drivers. Somehow (like on another computer or by connecting your phone to your pc to use USB tethering) download [Snappy Driver Installer Origin](https://www.snappy-driver-installer.org/). 

Extract it, and start the software with `SDIO_auto.bat`. Then select the `Download Network Drivers Only` option. It will start the download of all the existing network drivers. 

If it finishes (you can monitor the process on the top side of the window), copy the whole folder to the other computer which doesn't have internet. Open on that computer the software, and install the missing network drivers. Or, if you used USB tethering, you can disconnect your phone and install your network drivers right away. After restart, you can scan the PC for more missing drivers, or better yet, go to the manufacturer's website, and download the drivers from there. -->
