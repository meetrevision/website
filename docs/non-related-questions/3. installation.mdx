### Installation stopped with an error 

First, verify the ISO. You can find the checksums on the [Verification page](/downloads/verification). You can get help with the verification in the [installation guide](/faq/install)'s section about it.

And if you use Rufus, switch to Ventoy. Help in the [installation guide](/faq/install#ventoy).

If the installation needs a driver, please refer to [this guide](/faq/non-related/drivers).
