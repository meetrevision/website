Since ReviOS is Windows, yes it is compatible.

For seamless use of FACEIT, it is recommended to install the most recent ReviOS builds to avoid any compatibility issues since the latest updates are necessary for FACEIT.

If you are using one of the recommended builds, and still cannot use FACEIT, probably another updates were released by Microsoft, which is required by FACEIT. A new build of ReviOS probably will be released too, soon.
