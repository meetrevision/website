Since ReviOS is Windows, yes it is compatible.

As of this moment (2022-10-28), the recommended builds of ReviOS are `10 22.12` and `11 22.12`.

The `22.11` and `22.10` builds are probably still compatible with FACEIT, but not for long. Keep in mind, we do not support and recommend those builds anymore.

If you are using one of the recommended builds, and still cannot use FACEIT, probably another updates were released by Microsoft, which is required by FACEIT. A new build of ReviOS probably will be released too, soon.
