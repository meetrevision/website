Not recommended, because **it will revert tweaks**, **reinstall bloatware** and cause setbacks with respect to privacy and other pre-applied features, might even **break your OS**.

**Windows Update** in the latest builds of ReviOS **is not disabled**, only the automatic update downloading and installation is, and in Settings the **Windows Update menu is hidden**. It is not disabled completely because half of the OS communicates through this service, for example the Store would not work.

If you still want to update, you can manually install updates or reactivate the Windows Update menu in Settings with the Revision Tool. For more information about the tool, please read [the section about it](/faq/related/superfetch).
