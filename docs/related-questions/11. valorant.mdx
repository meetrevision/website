Either [turn on Windows Defender](#how-can-i-enable-windows-defender-or-superfetch-sysmain-or-uac-or-notifications-revision-tool), and you can enable Control Flow Guard in Windows Security,

or run these commands in a PowerShell terminal as administrator:

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name vgc.exe -Enable CFG
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name vgc.exe -Enable DEF
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name vgc.exe -Enable AuditDynamicCode
```
