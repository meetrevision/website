import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

  **This is an EXPERIMENTAL Method**. We tested it numerous times, but obviously we cannot cover all the edge cases, so use this with caution!
</Admonition>


With newer builds of ReviOS we provide 2 separate ISOs. One for installing a completely new ReviOS instance, and one for upgrading a previous ReviOS installation. This way, the users can update their ReviOS instance **without reinstalling and losing files**.

For instructions and more information about upgrading your older ReviOS instance, please read our **[How to upgrade ReviOS](/faq/upgrade)** guide.

If you want to upgrade because of FACEIT, make sure to check out [the section about it](/faq/related/faceit).
