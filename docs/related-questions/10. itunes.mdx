It is because ReviOS lacks some Apple drivers, which you could download only by Windows Update, but that is still not recommended. Instead, you can use [3uTools](http://www.3u.com/) to repair the drivers.

Once installed, after opening the software, go to:

1. `Toolbox`
2. `iTunes Utility`
3. `Repair Driver`
4. `Advanced Repair`

There select `Uninstall the old driver files stored in system`. After, iTunes should work.
