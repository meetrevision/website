### IMPORTANT
- Based on Windows 10 21H2 (`19044.1806`)
  - [Latest Cumulative Updates for .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.8](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/june-14-2022-kb5013887-cumulative-update-for-net-framework-3-5-and-4-8-for-windows-10-version-20h2-windows-server-version-20h2-windows-10-version-21h1-and-windows-10-version-21h2-b3bba918-9e0e-49cf-81e4-ab86ab7f76b6)

### NEW
- Updated the Workspace folder with Revision Tool
  - It previously was only intended for Windows Defender and later Superfetch, although we decided to expand it by adding some useful tweaks for ReviOS users, like enabling/disabling Windows Updates section, automatically drivers updating, notifications, etc.
  - Right now, this is a temporary tool and our team is working on transforming it to a GUI program to make it more user-friendly
- Disabled SleepStudy
- Enabled [Full Screen Optimizations](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/demystifying-full-screen-optimizations/)
  - Disabling FSO is no longer recommended on newer Windows 10 & 11 builds, although we provide a solution to enable it globally via Revision Tool
- Disabled transparency effects
- Changed Network Throttling Index to (decimal) 10

### FIXED
- Poor performance on some systems (by reverting Preemption to default)
