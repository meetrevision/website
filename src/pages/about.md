# About

## Presenting Revision

As a group of friends and tech enthusiasts from all over the world, we have dedicated ourselves to the idea of sharing insights and ideas freely among us. Our picture of the internet is that of a country without borders and we cherish cultural diversity without exception. We embrace the concept of open source, open knowledge and collaboration, sharing the belief among us that information should be free and never have a price tag. Where others hoard knowledge to gain an advantage, we share it and where people sell information, we give it away for free.

Should our project or our community help you in any way, we would greatly appreciate you [joining](https://discord.gg/962y4pU) and in turn sharing your knowledge with others as an active part of our group. We highly value creative input and credit every contribution, following the example of the scientific world, where quoting without giving credit is seen as plagiarism.

Credit where credit is due.
