Windows-based ISOs found on Revision's site are developed for educational purposes only, which ambitions a great effort to reverse engineer, disable, remove, or replace components of the Microsoft Windows operating system. The goal is an endeavor to better understand and mitigate the collection of Personally identifiable information (PII), as has been clearly defined by numerous outlets covering the topic. Another objective is to replace and/or alter included proprietary Windows files, such as the Windows UI files and Registry with ethically verifiable alternatives from earlier Windows versions. We also aim to greatly enhance the base performance of the OS to provide a better, snappier and more fluid productivity and gaming experience.

EU Directive 2009/24, on the legal protection of computer programs, governs reverse engineering in the European Union. The directive states:

*"(15) The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorisation of the rightholder. An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program."*

The intentions as self-described by Revision's Windows projects, clearly fall under the case-scenario of enabling better "interoperability", as the prevalence of proprietary software bundled with the Windows operating system does not constitute an open standard in this regard.
